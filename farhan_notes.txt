----------------

* Continue working on the PendingVolunteer merge. Test the Volunteer--Volunteer merge as well.
* Launch point on the "Add Participant" page on workday.
* Migration for converting the existing pending volunteers.
* Add waiver date to the grid.


TODO for later
 * How to lookup the password min length from db for User class? See user model.
 * Will new volunteers have a different set of interests?
 * Is it OK to assume that all pending volunteers will be resolved when the upgrade is done?  This way we don't have to worry about conversions.
 * Delete Volunteer.pending_volunteer_id


* See if there is a different way to label the "use" fields on the merge screens (see resolve_fields_table).
