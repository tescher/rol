Now allowing the user to add a check out time.
* Switched to Tim's fedex gem.
* Removed the additional sorting on the self tracking index action because it was excluding the pending volunteers.  I have tried a few different methods, but haven't had luck getting any of them to work so this is a short-term workaround.
* Now respecting autofocus on dialog forms.
----------------





TODO for later
--------------
 * Eventually delete Volunteer.pending_volunteer_id
 * Add test case for checking pending volunteers on the add_participate page.
 * Delete the *out.xml files.


QUESTIONS
---------
 * What is the workday_volunteers.old_id used for?


TESTING NOTES
-------------
Starting from scratch...
rake db:reset RAILS_ENV=test
rake test


Running a specific test...
rake test TEST=test/integration/volunteers_edit_test.rb

While writing tests, you can run `guard` so it watches for changes and automatically executes any changed tests.
