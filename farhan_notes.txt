Implemented the check-in time validations
 * Please note that the volunteer cannot put in a check-out time in the current implementation; i.e. they get checked out at Time.now.
 * Now sorting the self tracking index page by start_time, first_name, last_name.
 * Fixed the volunteer search in the self tracking workflow, and updated the test cases.

 * This issue is also applicable (no close button shows up): http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8681707/jqueryui-modal-dialog-does-not-show-close-button-x
 * Now that we are including volunteers.js, test the relevant pages to ensure that it didn't break anything.  Are there other affected files?


TODO for later
--------------
 * Eventually delete Volunteer.pending_volunteer_id
 * Add test case for checking pending volunteers on the add_participate page.
 * Delete the *out.xml files.


QUESTIONS
---------
 * What is the workday_volunteers.old_id used for?


TESTING NOTES
-------------
Starting from scratch...
rake db:reset RAILS_ENV=test
rake test


Running a specific test...
rake test TEST=test/integration/volunteers_edit_test.rb

While writing tests, you can run `guard` so it watches for changes and automatically executes any changed tests.
