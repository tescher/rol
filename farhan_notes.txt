PQA Changes
* Now properly moving the workdays when merging pending volunteers into volunteers.
* Fixed typo "To secure the system, *your* will be logged out of the system." Changed to "To secure the system, you will be logged out."
* Removed the "New Volunteer Sign-Up" button from the Self-Tracking screen. This will force the user to search first.
* Changed "Sign-up" to "New Volunteer" on the search dialog box to match the wording elsewhere in the system.
* Added a workaround to change the style on the period button (AM/PM) in the datetimepicker
* Commented out the `puts` in code for cleaner test runs.
* Fixed a jquery error in dialog initialization (loadDialog function).

----------------

 * What additional logic do I need when checking in people?  Should a person be allowed to check-in multiple times a day, overlapping check-ins, etc.? *TWE - I would see if they are already in a checked-in state as of the time they want to check in. That way in they left for a while (lunch?) then tried to check-in after lunch it would stop them, and they would have to check-out of their pre-lunch shift first. If they try to check-in for a time earlier than their last check-in, I would let them because they may be coming back from lunch and realized they forgot to check in for the morning shift. Make sense? Would need to make sure that the reporting handles the different cases smartly.

 * controllers/self_tracking_controller defines two additional classes for the volunteer search and the check-in functionality.  I am not sure if this is the appropriate place for defining these classes. *TWE - For the search can we use the same volunteer search code and either put it in the model or in a helper? 

 * The criteria seems a little loose so please pay special attention to that (self_tracking#volunteer_search). *TWE - for some reason when I put in "e,t" I get myself as well as Bill Escher (my dad)



TODO for later
--------------
 * Now that we are including volunteers.js, test the relevant pages to ensure that it didn't break anything.
 * You cannot find pending volunteers from the logged-in Workday search screen
 * This issue is also applicable (no close button shows up): http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8681707/jqueryui-modal-dialog-does-not-show-close-button-x
 * Eventually delete Volunteer.pending_volunteer_id
 * Add test case for checking pending volunteers on the add_participate page.
 * Delete the *out.xml files.

TESTING NOTES
-------------
Starting from scratch...
rake db:reset RAILS_ENV=test
rake test


Running a specific test...
rake test TEST=test/integration/volunteers_edit_test.rb

While writing tests, you can run `guard` so it watches for changes and automatically executes any changed tests.
