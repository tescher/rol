Wrote the tests for the self-tracking controller.
* Added guard-minitest for automatically running tests on file change.

----------------
* Delete the *out.xml files.


TODO for later
 * Do I really need the token or will saving in session suffice?
 * Eventually delete Volunteer.pending_volunteer_id
 * Add test case for checking pending volunteers on the add_participate page.


QUESTIONS
* Do we need to worry about pagination on the check-in/check-out listing table.
* Do we need to worry about the organizations in any way in this flow?
 * Is it OK to assume that all pending volunteers will be resolved when upgrading?  This way we don't have to worry about conversions.
* Pagination on search results.
* Should we require at least three characters of the last name in the search?
* Do I need recaptcha on the new volunteer sign-up page on the self-sign-in flow?
