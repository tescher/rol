Started implementing the volunteer self-tracking functionality.
* Qualified the button styling a little so we can use btn-default with proper font color.
* Refactored the soundex where clause into Volunteer.get_fuzzymatch_where_clause.
* Committing before I delete some of the sensitive data.

----------------
* Expire self tracking after a day (currently it doesn't seem to have a limit).
* Fix the launching url reference (it's broken now that I am using scope in routes).


TODO for later
 * Do I really need the token or will saving in session suffice?
 * Is it OK to assume that all pending volunteers will be resolved when the upgrade is done?  This way we don't have to worry about conversions.
 * Delete Volunteer.pending_volunteer_id
 * See if there is a different way to label the "use" fields on the merge screens (see resolve_fields_table).


QUESTIONS
* Do I need to worry about pagination on the check-in/check-out listing table.
* Do I need to worry about the organizations?
* Should we require at least three characters of the last name in the search?
