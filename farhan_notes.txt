Deleted workdays.coffee because it was also causing workdays.js to be ignored.
 * Re jquery dialog's missing close button issue (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8681707/jqueryui-modal-dialog-does-not-show-close-button-x): Deleting workdays.coffee now seems to have included the workdays.js, which defines a better workday summary link hook that added a "Close" button to the bottom of the dialog. So, this bootstrap conflict isn't meaningful anymore.

TODO for later
--------------
 * Eventually delete Volunteer.pending_volunteer_id
 * Add test case for checking pending volunteers on the add_participate page.
 * Delete the *out.xml files.


QUESTIONS
---------
 * What is the workday_volunteers.old_id used for?


TESTING NOTES
-------------
Starting from scratch...
rake db:reset RAILS_ENV=test
rake test


Running a specific test...
rake test TEST=test/integration/volunteers_edit_test.rb

While writing tests, you can run `guard` so it watches for changes and automatically executes any changed tests.
