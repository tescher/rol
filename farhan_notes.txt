Implemented most of the functionality, now working on the test cases.
* Qualified the button styling a little so we can use btn-default with proper font color.
* Refactored the soundex where clause into Volunteer.get_fuzzymatch_where_clause.
* Committing before I delete some of the sensitive data.
* Made the flash messages dismissible.

----------------
* Write the tests.
* Delete the *out.xml files.


TODO for later
 * Do I really need the token or will saving in session suffice?
 * Eventually delete Volunteer.pending_volunteer_id


QUESTIONS
* Do we need to worry about pagination on the check-in/check-out listing table.
* Do we need to worry about the organizations in any way in this flow?
 * Is it OK to assume that all pending volunteers will be resolved when upgrading?  This way we don't have to worry about conversions.
* Pagination on search results.
* Should we require at least three characters of the last name in the search?
* Do I need recaptcha on the new volunteer sign-up page on the self-sign-in flow?
