Now not requiring recaptcha when launching new pending volunteer action while self tracking is enabled.
* Now deleting the self tracking keys on log in and log out.
----------------





TODO for later
--------------
 * Eventually delete Volunteer.pending_volunteer_id
 * Add test case for checking pending volunteers on the add_participate page.
 * Delete the *out.xml files.


QUESTIONS
---------
 * What is the workday_volunteers.old_id used for?


TESTING NOTES
-------------
Starting from scratch...
rake db:reset RAILS_ENV=test
rake test


Running a specific test...
rake test TEST=test/integration/volunteers_edit_test.rb

While writing tests, you can run `guard` so it watches for changes and automatically executes any changed tests.
